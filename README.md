# Procrastinated-
A repo For the concert ticket booking web application

The main branch will be where we have the finalized version of the web app( or what we are comfortable with)
Avoid adding anything to this branch until everyone in the group agrees that it(the file/code) is okay

Although you can add shit without restrictions in the secondary branchðŸ‘€
The 2nd branch will basically have everything that the main has but is free to be used for testing and experimentation of everything

Feel free to create more branches
